- Hi, I’m @StanCampbell
- I am a Psychological and Behavioural Sciences student, and I have recently completed my final year dissertation
- I have created this page to demonstrate some of the things I have learned in the process, which includes MATLAB code
- Here are some of the scripts that I wrote to perform pre-processing on first-person phenomenological data and third-person EEG data

These scripts were partially inspired by scripts found at:
- https://github.com/bejachs/Dreem_Pipeline
- https://github.com/bejachs/AdaptedGraphDigitization
- https://github.com/SridharJagannathan/manage_badTrials
